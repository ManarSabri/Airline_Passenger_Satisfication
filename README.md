# Passenger Satisfaction Analysis and Solution Proposal

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that focus on analyzing passenger satisfaction data and proposing solutions to enhance overall passenger satisfaction for an airline. The notebooks are divided into two parts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.

## Notebook 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
In this notebook, we perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis of passenger satisfaction data. We examine various factors influencing passenger satisfaction, including age, gender, ticket class, flight distance, and more. We aim to gain insights into passenger demographics and their satisfaction levels.

### Key Insights
1. Customized Service Offerings: Airlines should tailor their services to cater to the unique preferences and needs of different passenger segments. For instance, understanding that Business Travelers tend to be older and value punctuality, airlines can prioritize on-time departures and arrivals for business-class passengers. In contrast, Personal Travelers might appreciate more in-flight entertainment options for shorter flights.

2. Improved Punctuality: The data clearly indicates that passengers who experience delays are more likely to express dissatisfaction or neutrality. Airlines should focus on optimizing schedules, minimizing delays, and providing accurate updates to passengers in case of disruptions.

3. Youth Engagement: Younger passengers (0-20 and 21-30 age groups) tend to express higher levels of dissatisfaction or neutrality. Airlines should engage with this demographic by offering special deals, promotions, and social media outreach to address their unique concerns and expectations.

4. Improved Personal Traveler Experience: Since Personal Travelers often cover shorter distances and may experience more delays, airlines can focus on streamlining boarding processes, offering entertainment options, and providing better customer service to make their journeys more enjoyable.

5. Age-Appropriate Services: Recognizing the varying satisfaction levels across different age groups, airlines can develop age-appropriate services and amenities. For example, older passengers may appreciate more comfortable seating options, while younger passengers may value digital entertainment offerings.

## Notebook 2: Machine Learning

### Overview
In this notebook, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict passenger satisfaction based on various features and historical data. We build predictive models to understand the factors that contribute most to passenger satisfaction and to identify areas for improvement.This predictive capability can help airlines anticipate and address potential satisfaction issues proactively.

### Key Tasks
1. Data Preprocessing: We clean and prepare the data for machine learning, including handling missing values and imbalanced data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

2. Model Building: We develop machine learning models, such as classification algorithms, to predict passenger satisfaction.

3. Model Evaluation: To measure how well our models perform, we use specific metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In this analysis, we focus on "recall" as a key metric. Think of recall as the ability of our model to catch satisfied passengers early on. We want to make sure we identify as many satisfied passengers as possible, even if it means making a few mistakes by flagging some passengers as satisfied when they are not. This way, we can take proactive steps to provide excellent service or incentives to keep our satisfied customers engaged and happy.

4. Feature Importance: We identify the most influential features contributing to passenger satisfaction, providing actionable insights for the airline.
